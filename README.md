## Configuration-based website architecture

This entire website is designed to be controlled via configuration files. All aspects of the site's behavior, appearance, and functionality can be modified through config files without requiring code changes. This approach enables non-technical users to manage content and settings, and allows for easy deployment across different environments with varying configurations.
